## Overview
In this project, we are studying the relationship between demographics and health risk factors. We are doing this with information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using a compelling visualization, we aim to share the powerful aspects of this data set in a way that users can interact with. 

## Method
Using the tools available through Javascript and D3, we will bind our data csv file to an interactive website. The website will contain an interactive scatter plot that will have each state's initials in the corresponding circle. The circles will also feature a hover over function that will display the true values from each X and Y axis so that users can access the true value from each point. The x and y axises will have 3 values each to select from. This will allow users to traverse through the whole data set in a visual way. They will be able to follow each state from category to category, or be able to draw conclusions in a broader sense by analyzing the trends of the whole country.
