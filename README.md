## Overview
In this project, we are studying the relationship between demographics and health risk factors. We are doing this with information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using a compelling visualization, we aim to share the powerful aspects of this data set in a way that users can interact with. 

## Method
Using the tools available through Javascript and D3, we will bind our data csv file to an interactive website. The website will contain an interactive scatter plot that will have each state's initials in the corresponding circle. The circles will also feature a hover over function that will display the true values from each X and Y axis so that users can access the true value from each point. The x and y axises will have 3 values each to select from. This will allow users to traverse through the whole data set in a visual way. They will be able to follow each state from category to category, or be able to draw conclusions in a broader sense by analyzing the trends of the whole country. 

## Analysis

### Healthcare / Income Level
There is a correlation that shows lower levels of income and an increase in the the lack of healthcare proved. Does the rising cost of healthcare prohibit active engagement in the healthcare system from the lowest levels of poverty?

### Income / Smoking Percentage

Higher levels of smoking percentage correlatate with a decrease in income across this data set. This point of data could be shown to policy makers in a way to help provide resources and education amongst these population groups in an aim to decrease the smoking percentage amongst the most affected. 

### Poverty / Obesity Percentage
Strong trend as Poverty% increases so does the Obesity% of the United States population. This finding would benefit from futher analysis on the access and affordability of healthy/fresh food in this areas of high obesity percentage. Where can resources be provided to expand access for this demographic? What type of educational programs could be installed to help citizens make healthier choices.
